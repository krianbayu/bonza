*I assume these data is about the call data between users because it contains start_time and end_time

Findings: 
1. Number of active users is decreased by 6% compared to its previous month (September).
2. Number of New User on October only 2.5% 
3. Most of users only use services for less then 15551 seconds (Based on histogram - question number 

Potential root cause:
1. I assume that there is an increase in the price of a call service under 15561 seconds
2. A decrease in the quality of the signal provided by the base station
3. There are 2 Islamic Holidays on October 2014 (Idul Adha, Islamic New Year), people could be take day off and visiting their family and not using call services during that day off
4. There could be a promotion from another company. 
5. There could be a promotion for another service (internet services), thus people tend to try that service and abandon the call service)
